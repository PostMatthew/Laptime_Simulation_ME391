# Hey Team,

This is the repository for a laptime simulation that I'm developing for [Lafayette Motorsports](https://sites.lafayette.edu/motorsports/) and for other [Formula Hybrid Teams](https://www.formula-hybrid.org/). 

This repository serves to host the various scripts/notebooks/data files used in the development of a design tool to allow for Formula Hybrid teams to be able to predict their lap times around a chosen track. This project is an indepent study course advised by Professor Alexander Brown ([Check out his Github!](https://github.com/Alexanderallenbrown?tab=repositories)).

I wanted to make this repository public while in development in order to allow people to follow alone but this project is in the early stages of development. So it's important to say:

#### THIS REPO AND ALL ENCOMPASSING CODE IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Until I update this README to say otherwise, please look at everything with a grain of salt.

Check out my wiki if you would like to see more of my progress and the documentation that I put together for my own personal understanding of vehicle dynamics, building a better race car, and the semi troubled rumblings of a second semester senior.

More to come as this project progresses!
