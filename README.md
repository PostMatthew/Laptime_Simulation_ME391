# Read me!

## Hey Team,

This is the repository for a laptime simulation that I'm developing for Lafayette Motorsports and for other Formula Hybrid Teams. 

This repository serves to host the various scripts/notebooks/data files used in the development of a design tool to allow for Formula Hybrid teams to be able to predict their lap times around a chosen track. This project is an indepent study course advised by Professor Alexander Brown ([Check out his Github!](https://github.com/Alexanderallenbrown?tab=repositories)).

Check out my wiki if you would like to see more of my progress and the documentation that I put together for my own personal understanding of vehicle dynamics, building a better race car, and the semi troubled rumblings of a second semester senior.

More to come as this project progresses!
